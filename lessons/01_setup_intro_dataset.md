## Learning Objectives

* Introduce the dataset and begin setup by loading data
* Describe the process of going from count matrix to annotated clusters
* Explore distribution of cluster annotations

## Introduction to the dataset
For this workshop, we will be using the single-cell RNA-seq dataset from [Shamsi et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00373-z). The primary focus of this study was to evaluate the changes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) at different temperatures. 

Cells were isolated from stromal vascular fraction of brown adipose tissue. After removal of all hematopoietic lineage-positive cells, 24,498 non-hematopoietic cells were re-clustered and visualisation of the clusters using UMAP identified eight major non-immune cell types present in BAT. This unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiles also revealed heterogeneity within each cell type, illustrated by the presence of multiple distinct clusters for each cell type.

The mice used in this study were housed in 4 different temperature conditions:
 - TN: 30 °C for 1 week
 - RT: 22 °C
 - cold2: 5 °C for 2 days
 - cold7: 5 °C for 7 days

There are four replicates per condition, except cold2 which has 3 replicates. This experimental design allowed for adequate comparison of gene expression for each celltype between conditions. For this workshop, we will be **using this clustered data set as a starting point** to demonstrate various approaches for **identifying differentially expressed genes in single cell RNA-seq data**.

### Raw data
The processed dataset is available on [GEO (GSE160585)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE160585) and the raw data is available for download on [SRA]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP290688). We chose to download the filtered counts data and metadata files, and use those to create  a Seurat object as our starting point. For more detailed information and code on how to create the object from the GEO files, please [see this lesson](00_gen_seurat_object.md).

### Relevant metadata
In addition to the counts matrix, we also need to collect information about the data; this is known as metadata. There is often a temptation to just start exploring the data, but it is not very meaningful if we know nothing about the samples that this data originated from.

Some relevant metadata for our dataset is provided below:

- Data were generated with the 10x chromium Single Cell 3′ version 3 reagent kit
- Sequenced on the NovaSeq S2 flow cell (Illumina, 100 cycles)
- Processed with Cell Ranger 3.0.1

## Set up

For this workshop, we will be working within an RStudio project. In order to follow along you should have **downloaded the R project**.

> If you haven't done this already, the project can be accessed using [this link]().

Once downloaded, you should see a file called `TODO` on your computer (likely, in your `Downloads` folder). 

1. Unzip this file. It will result in a folder of the same name. 
2. **Move the folder to the location on your computer where you would like to perform the analysis.**
3. Open up the folder. The contents will look like the screenshot below. 
4. **Locate the `.Rproj file` and double-click on it.** This will open up RStudio with the "DGE_scRNA" project loaded.

## Project organization

One of the most important parts of research that involves large amounts of data, is how best to manage it. We tend to prioritize the analysis, but there are many other important aspects of **data management that are often overlooked** in the excitement to get a first look at new data. The [HMS Data Management Working Group](https://datamanagement.hms.harvard.edu/), discusses in-depth some things to consider beyond the data creation and analysis.

For each experiment you work on and analyze data for, it is considered best practice to get organized by creating **a planned storage space (directory structure)**. We will do that for our single-cell analysis. 

Look inside your project space and you will find that a directory structure has been setup for you:

```
DGE_scRNA/
├── data
├── results
└── figures
```

> **NOTE FOR WINDOWS OS users** - When you open the project folder after unzipping, please check if you have a `data` folder with a sub folder also called `data`. If this is the case, please move all the files from the subfolder into the parent `data` folder.


## Loading single-cell RNA-seq count data 

Next, let's open a new Rscript file, and start with some comments to indicate what this file is going to contain:

```r
# September 2024
# HBC single-cell RNA-seq DGE workshop

# Single-cell RNA-seq analysis - metadata
```

Save the Rscript as `metadata.R`. Your working directory should look something like this:

**TODO: image of file explorer**

### Loading libraries 

Next, we can load the necessary libraries:

```r
# Load libraries
library(Seurat)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggalluvial)
```

### Load Seurat object

We generated this Seurat object using the using the files that were deposited to GEO. More details on how this seurat object is detailed in another [lesson](00_gen_seurat_object.md), where we provide more clarity on what parameters were used for normalization, integration, and clustering. 

Let's begin by looking at what metadata is stored inside the Seurat object, paying close attention to sample identities and celltype annotations.

```r
seurat <- readRDS("data/BAT_GSE160585.rds")
colnames(seurat@meta.data)
```

```
 [1] "orig.ident"             "nCount_RNA"             "nFeature_RNA"          
 [4] "sample"                 "log10GenesPerUMI"       "mitoRatio"             
 [7] "condition"              "S.Score"                "G2M.Score"             
[10] "Phase"                  "CC.Difference"          "nCount_SCT"            
[13] "nFeature_SCT"           "integrated_snn_res.1.2" "celltype"              
[16] "seurat_clusters"   
```

A nice way to observe patterns or trends in the data is to visualize it, especially when we are working with such a large number of cells!

### Sample distribution

Recall from the summary above that we have cells from four different conditions. We can use a barplot to show the number of cells for each replicate, coloring each sample by the temperature condition the mice were subjected to.

```r
ggplot(seurat@meta.data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x=sample, fill=condition),
             stat="count", color="black") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1)) +
    labs(x="Sample name", y="Number of cells")
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/sample_info_ncells.png" width="600">
</p>

We can also see the distribution of cells across the UMAP for each replicate and sample.

```r
DimPlot(seurat, group.by=c("sample", "condition"))
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/sample_info_sample_umap.png" width="1000">
</p>


### Celltype annotation
We had also mentioned that the cells had been annotated into 8 major non-immune cell types:
    
1. Pdgfra+ adipose preogenitors
2. Vasculat endothelial
3. Lymphatic endothelial
4. Vascular smooth muscle cells
5. Pericytes
6. Adipocytes
7. Myelinating Schwann cells
8. Non-myelinating Schwann cells
   
Intiallly, cells were clustered at a range of resolutions. The authors chose a resolution 0.2 and celltypes were assigned based upon expression of a variety of marker genes. The mapping of cluster to celltype annotation is being represented here as an **alluvial plot**.

```r
ggplot(seurat@meta.data,
        aes(axis1 = seurat_clusters,
            axis2 = celltype,
            fill = celltype)) +
    geom_alluvium() +
    geom_stratum() +
    geom_text(stat = "stratum",
        aes(label=after_stat(stratum))) +
    theme_void() +
    NoLegend() +
    coord_flip()
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="../img/sample_info_celltype_map.png" height="500">
</p>

We can also use celltype labels, and see how they distribute on the UMAP. 

```r
# UMAP celltype
Idents(seurat) <- "celltype"
p <- DimPlot(seurat) + NoLegend()
LabelClusters(p, id = "ident",  fontface = "bold", size = 4,
              bg.colour = "white", bg.r = .2, force = 0)
```

<p align="center" style="display:flex">
    <img src="../img/sample_info_celltype_umap.png" width="40%">
</p>


We can identify celltypes that could be interesting based upon the proportion of conditions found in each celltype.

```r
# Barplot sample proportion by celltype 
ggplot(seurat@meta.data) +
    geom_bar(aes(x=celltype, fill=condition), 
                 position=position_fill(), color="black") +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(x="Cluster", y="Proportion of cells")
```
