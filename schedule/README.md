### Before the next class:

I. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:
 
   1. [Aggregating by celltype using pseudobulk approach]()
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
       <br> Running DESeq2 on the aggregated count matrix. <br><br>In this lesson you will:<br>
             - Aggregate counts for each celltype<br>
             - Sample level QC for a given celltype (PCA and hierarchical clustering)<br>
             - Visualizations to bring it back to the single cell level <br><br>
<br>
        </details>

  2. [Automating pseudobulk aggregation using for loops]()
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
       <br> Demonstrate how to run this for different celltypes. <br><br>In this lesson you will:<br>
             - Complete exercise for running through with another celltype<br><br>
        </details>
